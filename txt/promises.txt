What are JS promises?
-A tool for handling asynchronous events in JavaScript. A promise represents an event that might not yet have happened. A promise will be in one of three states:

 Pending: the event has not yet happened.
 Resolved: the event has happened successfully.
 Rejected: the event has happened, and an error condition occurred.

Why should I care about JS promises?

They're also used a lot in JS libraries.

How do JS promises relate to what I already know?
-JS promises relate to the jqXhr object from jQuery AJAX requests.

How do I create and use JS promises?
-Most commonly, a special value to be handled (Fetch API).
You can create your own as well.

How will I likely use promises in the future (what is the real world application)?
-Real world applications will include API calls, database operations, etc.
